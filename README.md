# Openshift-metalkube-virtual-infra
This repository has the scripts that automates the deployment of virtual machines that simulates bare-metal environment for Ironic.

MetalKube Installer Dev Scripts
===============================

This set of scripts configures some libvirt VMs and associated
[virtualbmc](https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/environments/virtualbmc.html) processes to enable deploying to them as dummy baremetal nodes.

This is very similar to how we do TripleO testing so we reuse some roles
from tripleo-quickstart here.

# Pre-requisites

- CentOS 7.5 or greater (installed from 7.4 or newer)
- file system that supports d_type (see Troubleshooting section for more information)
- ideally on a bare metal host
- run as a user with passwordless sudo access
- get a valid pull secret (json string) from https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install#pull-secret

# Instructions

## Configuration

Make a copy of the `config_example.sh` to `config_$USER.sh`, and set the
`PULL_SECRET` variable to the secret obtained from cloud.openshift.com.

For baremetal test setups where you don't require the VM fake-baremetal nodes,
you may also set `NODES_FILE` to reference a manually created json file with
the node details (see [ironic_hosts.json.example](ironic_hosts.json.example)),
and `NODES_PLATFORM` which can be set to e.g "baremetal" to disable the libvirt
master/worker node setup. See [common.sh](common.sh) for other variables that
can be overridden.
